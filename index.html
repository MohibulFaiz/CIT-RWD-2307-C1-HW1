<p>In this context, she said that during the Awami League government, the country has been promoted from LDC to a developing country while in 2015 it has been put in the lower middle income country group.</p>
<br>
<p>She also mentioned that the per capita income has increased to $2,824, which was $543 only in 2006, the poverty rate has decreased from about 41.5 percent to about 18.7 percent and the extreme poverty rate has decreased from 25.5 percent to 5.6 percent.</p>

<br>
<p>Pointing out that the development of the country is not possible without democracy, the Prime Minister said that she returned to the country in 1981 and worked to restore the country's democracy through a long struggle.</p>
<br>
<p>Stating that her government has provided houses to 50 lakh homeless and landless people, Sheikh Hasina said that not a single person will remain homeless and landless in the country.</p>
<br>
<p>The Prime Minister mentioned that the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war and subsequent sanctions and counter-sanctions have put pressure on the economy of Bangladesh, like the rest of the world, due to the increase in global food products and fuel prices.</p>
<br>
<p>However, Sheikh Hasina said that her government has been trying to overcome this pressure.</p>
<br>
<p>Pointing out that there is a need to have a vision to build the future of a nation, Sheikh Hasina said that before the 2008 elections, the Awami League announced the Vision 2021 and that vision has already been implemented.</p>
<br>
<p>She said that the government has announced the Vision 2041 to make Bangladesh a developed, prosperous and smart Bangladesh.</p>
<br>
<p>Sheikh Hasina said that the government has been working to implement that goal.</p>
